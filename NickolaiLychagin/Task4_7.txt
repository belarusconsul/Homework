 Task 4.7*
 1. Run the module modules/mod_a.py. Check its result. Explain why does
 this happen. 
 2. Try to change x to a list [1,2,3]. Explain the result.
 3. Try to change import to from x import * where x - module names.
 Explain the result.

 1. First we import mod_c, which sets mod_c.x equal to 5. Then we import
 mod_b which sets mod_c.x equal to 5. Then we print mod_c.x.
 2. First we import mod_c, which sets mod_c.x equal to [1,2,3]. Then we import
 mod_b which sets mod_c.x equal to 5. Then we print mod_c.x.
 3. When we import a module like 'import mod_c' we should reference its
 variables prepending them with the module name. Direct names are not
 seen by the current scope. When we import a module like 'from mod_c import *'
 we copy all its variables to the current scope. After that 'x' and 'mod_c.x'
 become independent of each other.
